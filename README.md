EvoFuzzy: Evolutionary fuzzy ensemble approach for reconstructing consensus genetic networks
EvoFuzzy, an algorithm that integrates evolutionary and fuzzy concepts to combine gene regulatory networks (GRNs) derived from Boolean, regression, and fuzzy models. The algorithm evolves a population of networks using fuzzy trigonometric differential evolution, with gene expression predictions based on confidence levels applied through a fuzzy logic-based predictor.
